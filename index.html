      <p class="indent">Hello world, my name is Luke Miller. I'm a currently finishing up my academic career studying
        computer science at the University of Arkansas. Making a portfolio site had been something I had wanted to do
        for
        a while, and I am glad I was given the time during quarantine to make it happen. This site is divided into four
        main sections, described below.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="Row">
      <a href="./blog/index.html" class="icon-link"><i data-feather="book-open" class="icons"></i></a>
      <p class="indent">The first section is a personal blog. This is a place for any writings or interests that I
        find
        might be good to get out to the world. This could include many personal interests of mine such as renewable
        energy, smart home technology, or visionary ideas of what the future might hold in technology. I am also a
        huge
        fan of
        Apple, so anything interesting about them that I find worth sharing, this is the place for that.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="Row">
      <a href="./projects/index.html" class="icon-link"><i data-feather="check-circle" class="icons"></i></a>
      <p class="indent">The second section is for personal projects. This is where I put all my ongoing or past
        projects. That could include programming projects I am working on or, I also enjoy DIY projects so a few of
        those may
        sneak their way in as well. Either way this is a great place to see what all I am up to when it comes to
        personal work.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="Row">
      <a href="https://github.com/lukelmiller" target="_blank" class="icon-link"><i data-feather="github" class="icons"></i></a>
      <p class="indent">The next section is my GitHub. This is a place you can find all the open-source code for all
        my
        current and past programming projects. Many of my repositories are from university courses, but some other
        projects of mine reside there as well. I have many, of what I think are, interesting projects. Some
        repositories
        of note are Capstone (personal inventory app), Mobile Programming (various different mobile apps developed for
        Android), and
        3D Tetris (3D game under the Graphics repo).</p>
    </div>


    
      <div class="Row">
        <a href="./me/index.html" class="icon-link"><i data-feather="user" class="icons"></i></a>
        <p class="indent">The final section is my about me page. This page is filed with info on my personal life. From
          academia to weight loss, my about me page holds many hurdles that I have overcome and the ideals I find worth
          striving for in life. This is the section that I am most proud of, and I am glad I have built this outlet to
          share some personal triumphs to the world.</p>
      </div>


    
      <div class="Row">
        <a href="./contact_me/index.html" class="icon-link"><i data-feather="mail" class="icons"></i></a>
        <p class="indent">You can find all these sections on the header above, as well as a contact me page on the
          footer
          below. Thank you for spending some of your time here and I hope you enjoy this site as much as I enjoyed
          making
          it!</p>
