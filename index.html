    <h2>WELCOME</h2>
    <hr>
    <br>
    <p class="indent">Hello world, my name is Luke Miller. I'm a currently finishing up my academic career studying
      computer science at the University of Arkansas. Making a portfolio site had been something I had wanted to do for
      a while, and I am glad I was given the time during quarantine to make it happen. This site is divided into four
      main sections, described below.</p>

    <a href="./blog/index.html">
      <p class="indent">The first section is a personal blog. This is a place for any writings or interests that I find
        might be good to get out to the world. This could include many personal interests of mine such as renewable
        energy, smart home technology, or visionary ideas of what the future might hold in technology. I am also a huge fan of
        Apple, so anything interesting about them that I find worth sharing, this is the place for that.</p>
    </a>

    <a href="./projects/index.html">
      <p class="indent">The second section is for personal projects. This is where I put all my ongoing or past
        projects. That could be programming projects I am working on or, I also enjoy DIY projects so a few of those may
        sneak their way in as well. Either way this is a great place to see what all I am up to when it comes to
        personal work.</p>
    </a>

    <a href="https://github.com/lukelmiller" target="_blank">
      <p class="indent">The next section is my GitHub. This is a place you can find all the open-source code for all my
        current and past programming projects. Many of my repositories are from university courses, but some other
        projects of mine reside there as well. I have many, of what I think are, interesting projects. Some repositories
        of note are Capstone (personal inventory app), Mobile Programming (many different mobile apps developed for Android), and
        3D Tetris (3D game under the Graphics repo).</p>
    </a>

    <a href="./me/index.html">
      <p class="indent">The final section is my about me page. This page is filed with info on my personal life. From
        academia to weight loss, my about me pages holds many hurdles that I have overcome and the ideals I find worth
        striving for in life. This is the section that I am most proud of, and I am glad I have built this outlet to
        share some personal stories to the world.</p>
    </a>

    <a href="./contact_me/index.html">
      <p class="indent">You can find all these sections on the header above, as well as a contact me page on the footer
        below. Thank you for spending some of your time here and I hope you enjoy this site as much as I enjoyed making
        it!.</p>
