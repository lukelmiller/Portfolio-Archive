      <h2>WELCOME</h2>
      <hr>
      <br>
      <p class="indent">Hello world, my name is Luke. I'm a student at the University of Arkansas,
        currently studying computer science. I have not written a website in a
        very long time so I decided to dust off my good ole html and css skills
        and get some stuff out there to the world. At the top you will find 4 places
        to go.</p></a>

      <a href="blog.html"><p class="indent"> First off my blog; a place for pretty much any thoughts I wanted to talk about
        and get out there. Whether that may be my love of Apple, or politics. Whatever
        that may be, I have sectioned off that part for my thoughts and writings.</p></a>

      <a href="projects.html"><p class="indent">Secondly my projects; this is where I am going to put my current projects, typically
        my programming projects. Although, every now and then I enjoy building or making
        something such as furniture or participating in interior design, as well as upgrading my smart
        home tech.</p></a>

      <a href="https://github.com/lukelmiller" target="_blank"><p class="indent">Next my github; a place where you can find any of my open source programs and projects to download.
        Right now a majority of my repositories are filled with projects from school, but soon this is going to become
        home to many personal projects.</p></a>

      <a href="me.html"><p class="indent">Finally my about me page; a page filled with info about my personal life and things
        I wish to share with everybody. This is home to some of my biggest achievements
        and things in my life of which I am extremely proud.
      </p></a>
