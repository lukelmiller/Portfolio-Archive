      <h3>Branches Piece</h3>

      <p class="indent"> I have this idea for an art piece for above my couch on
        the wall. There is this space that I have been really wanting to fill,
        but I don’t really want just any piece that I can get off the shelves.
        I want something truly special. When I was five my parents had the
        opportunity to buy some land outside of the city [Springfield, MO]. This
        is where they got the privilege to build the home I grew up in. This land
        is the real privilege though; 14 acres of pure natural Splenda. So, in the
        spirit of this little section of earth I grew up on I want to take a branch
        and section it into 3 parts and three frames. The three parts symbolize
        my two siblings and I splitting apart taking what we have learned from the
        trunk, my parents, and building our own frame, or family. I wish to construct this
        with my father while we both have free time together, and I think it will
        make a beautiful piece to show to the people who visit me in my little world/apartment.
      </p>
        <p class = "indent">[UPDATE 4.24] The project is mostly complete! Just
        waiting on the glue to harden completely, but all in all I think it turned
        out fantastic! My father picked out a beautiful branch, and the frame was
         not without some flaws from the stain
        clumping a bit, but it ended up gorgeous. Super happy with how
        it turned out and I cannot wait to see what visitors think.

      <h3>Portfolio Website</h3>

      <img id="i0" src="https://lukelmiller.me/images/websiteProject.png" alt="Site Layout Blueprint">
      <p class="indent">I have kinda been itching to start a site for a while now.
         I wasn’t quite sure what I wanted it to be, but I was afraid my skills
         in web dev were going to wither and with me probably joining the CS
         career market, I figured ok. I have more free time now than ever with
         having to shelter in place, and how hard can joining back in the ranks
         of web dev be. Oh my oh my, how I have forgotten how hard it is to design
         something with css. I decided to start with a simple floating header and
         it took me a few days but, I am glad to say, my skills have been renewed.
         I do plan on keeping the site up to date. I am very satisfied with
         the progress I have made, though!</p>

      <p class="indent">I do still have goals for this project. First I do want
        to optimize the website more, like clean up my css and get rid of stuff
        I do not need. I also wanna make sure there is no responsive design issues.
        One of the goals with the site was to create a place for my writing, I am
        really proud of how my blog turned out, now I just have to keep pace and
        keep adding entries. Lastly I want to make sure my site is as secure as
        it can be. Although the site is quite static and no data is really being
        transferred I want to see if I can make any more security improvements
        other than using an encrypted SSH. Plus who knows what the future holds,
        maybe an infinite scrolling blog list, individual blog pages per post, or
        hopefully better photos (a photo with a horse maybe?) who knows… the
        possibilities are endless!!</p>
