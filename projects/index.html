      Some people have a hard time keeping track of their stuff. They do not know the best practices for tracking where
      stuff is, how much a thing is worth, or even roughly how much all their stuff is worth. That is where InventorME comes in.
      InventorME is a cloud synced personal inventory application that allows you to track your stuff wherever and
      however you want. InventorME is cross platform so you can add an item on your phone then log into your desktop and
      edit it on the big screen. The user interface is simple, clean, and extremely easy to use. You can even scan an
      item’s barcode to automatically fill in it's info while adding it to your library in app. The design allows you to see
      your things in many different views such as a collections view, an archive view, a folders view, and even a
      global, all items, view. You can also search your items if you have created a large library of items in your
      account. InventorME is secure leveraging Amazon Web Services’ latest technologies stack to make your content
      is secure and private. We even back up photos of your items and sync them across all devices. InventorME was my
      team’s final project for the University’s Computer Science program. My team worked extremely hard, and the results
      paid off. We got an excellent score on the project, and I am proud of the work they put in.

    <h3>Branches Piece</h3>
    <img src="../images/complete.png" alt="Completed Project Badge" class="badge">
    <h6>Start: 4.19.2020</h6>

    <p class="indent">I have this idea for an art piece for above my couch on the wall. There is this space that I have
      been really wanting to fill, but I don’t really want just any piece that I can get off the shelves. I want
      something truly special. When I was five my parents had the opportunity to buy some land outside of the city
      [Springfield, MO]. This is where they got the privilege to build the home I grew up in. This land is the real
      privilege though; 14 acres of pure natural Splenda. So, in the spirit of this little section of earth I grew up on
      I want to take a branch and section it into 3 parts within three frames. I hoping to construct the frame with my
      dad while we both have some free time together, and I think it will make a beautiful piece to show to the people
      who visit me in my apartment.
    </p>
    <p class="indent">[UPDATE 4.24] The project is mostly complete. I’m just waiting on the glue to harden completely,
      but all in all it turned out fantastic. My father picked out the beautiful branch, and although the frame was not
      without some flaws from the stain clumping a bit, it ended up gorgeous. Super happy with how it turned out and I
      cannot wait to see what visitors think.

    <h3>Portfolio Website</h3>
    <img src="../images/ongoing.png" alt="Inprogress Badge" class="badge">
    <h6>Start: 3.25.2020</h6>
    <br>
    <img id="i0" src="../images/websiteProject.png" alt="Site Layout Blueprint">
    <p class="indent">I have been itching to start a website for a while now. I wasn’t quite sure what I wanted it to
      be, but I was afraid my skills in web development were starting to wither. I figured being in quarantine would be
      a better time than ever. I also figured since I was going into my senior year of college having a portfolio
      website might come in handy when I decide to start job hunting. I decided to start with a simple floating header,
      and it took me a few days but, I am glad to say, my skills have been renewed. I really did forget how hard plain
      HTML and CSS is to style. I think I have a great foundation for the site and so far, I am happy with its design.
    </p>
    <p class="indent">I do still have goals for this project. First, I do want to optimize the website more, like clean
      up my CSS and get rid of stuff I do not need. I also want to make sure everything is responsive and looks good on
      even the smallest of screens. One of the goals with the site was to create a place for my writing, I am proud of
      how my blog turned out, I am hoping to keep pace and add more entries soon. Lastly, I want to make sure my site is
      as secure as it can be. Although the site is quite static, and no data is really being transferred, I want to see
      if I can make add more security improvements such as an encrypted SSH.</p>
    <p class="indent">[UPDATE 5.25.21] I am updating the site to mature its contents a tad. I wish to make it look more
      professional for potential people looking to hire me. The site’s design, I believe, still looks great. I am just
      going through the content on the pages and making the information more presentable, and less jokey. I am also
      adding a few new sections to the “Me” page and retroactively adding previous projects and their descriptions to
      the “Projects” page to round out the “portfolio” part of my portfolio website.</p>
