      <p class="indent">Education has always been important aspect of my life. Everyday I attempt to consistently learn
         something new. The thirst for knowledge was the greatest
         gift my parents ever passed down, and I strive everyday to gain
         knowledge, through any avenue possible. Currently I attend college at the
         University of Arkansas but I am proud be apart of many other
         communities for learning.</p>

      <h3>Color</h3>
      <br>
      <p class="indent">When I was in grade school I had this art teacher, very impatient to
      be teaching young kids or even art for that matter. She would tell us to
      grab a color or draw a sky and always just get so frustrated when I grabbed
      the wrong color. Some times I would grab the color she needed or drew the
      correct color of my subject, but every so often I would be off. It was not
      consistent which is why I think it perturbed her so much. Well long down
      the line, probably way too long, I discovered that like my brother I was
      color blind. Also come to find out I am also dyslexic, like my father.
      I remember my 'speed math’ problems taking me 6x as long as the other kids,
      and when my brother and I would play slug-bug my parents would chuckle
      when we would call a blue car purple.</p>
      <p  class="indent">These were things I never knew made me different. These things were never disabilities for me, if
      anything they just slow me down a tad and cause some hick-ups now and again,
      also are great for comedy, but to imagine living life without sight or
      the ability to hear. Those are the things for which the world is not
      designed. So when I set to create or build something, I design it to
      be accommodating to everyone. Whether that be applications that take
      full advantage of accessibility features or decorating my home to
      where everyone can feel safe and be able to use everything in it without
      boundaries. Good design is built for everyone, because why are you designing
      something for, if everyone cannot use it. </p>

      <h3>Family</h3>
      <br>
      <p class="indent">Miriam Primrose Miller was my grandmother on my fathers side. She was
      a mother to 3 daughters and 5 sons, grandmother to 30+ grandkids, and
      great-grandmother to 40+ great-grandchildren. She was a complete LEGEND.
      One of the sweetest ladies I have ever know. She was the one who taught
      me the importance of family and taking care of others. She would give
      her house to  anyone homeless who needed a roof for the night or feed
      you the little food she had in her fridge because she “didn’t need it”.
      She ended up living the last few years of her life in my parents home
      where we got to give back some of the love and care she gave so many
      throughout her 90 years. I carry those lessons of love in my heart
      everyday. Everyday I try to treat the people around me like I would
      family; we are all spinning on this rock together and if we treat others
      with love, that’s when we’re most equip to defeat hate.</p>

      <h3>Lost</h3>
      <br>
      <p class="indent">Growing up a chunky kid teaches you lots of lessons in
        character: how to deal with bullies, how to deal with low self confidence,
         and the only person’s opinion about you that matters is the opinion of
         yourself. I always grew up thinking one day I would lose the weight and
         even when picturing my future I always saw myself skinny. It was only a
         matter of time before I came to terms with myself. It would require an
         enormous change in my life and that was not an easy self confrontation.
         Sophomore year I decided that it was time for that change.</p>

     <p class="indent">I worked out about an hour everyday and counted calories
        till I retrained my mind to eat healthy. After tons of hard work I lost
        about 2 pounds a week for a year. 100 pounds later, I went from 270 pounds
        all the way down to 168. That wasn’t the end of my journey though. I
        dealt with lots of self confidence issues; you can go from being large
        your whole life to all the sudden skinny, its unprecedented for your
        inward self. I am proud today to finally have fought for self confidence
        and won. After years of people putting me down, I finally build myself
        up, that is something that emboldened my heart and those people only
        made me stronger for it, and for that I am grateful.</p>

      <h3>Pride</h3>
      <br>
      <p class="indent">	September 16, 2017; After dealing with so much pain in my heart and soul,
      I had realize it was time to finally be me. On this day I decided to finally
      tell my parents that I am gay, two weeks later I came out to my siblings,
      and now I live everyday proud of who I am. I can live in a world where I
      do not have to hide what is underneath, and for that I am so grateful.
      I have so much support from my friends and family and I cannot explain
      to anyone how wonderful it is to have such amazing people in your life
      that will support you no matter who you are.</p>
      <p class="indent">Through all this, I try to live every day putting in the work to support
      everyone around me, no matter what they look like or how they speak or any
      way their life might be different from mine or the small world I grew up in.
      Fairness and equality make up so much of my life and behavior, I believe
      this world wasn’t meant for any one soul, but everyone. Being together
      as one humanity is what makes us strong, this earth is one we all walk
      on with no choice in how the world comes at us, but all the choice in
      how we treat the world.

      <h3>Programming</h3>
      <br>
      <p class="indent">Senior year of high school I got offered the opportunity to go to the local
      community college in the mornings and attend classes for free through my high
      school. I looked through the different programs they had, know I wanted to do
      something with computers and I came across a program called “Computer Information
      Science (CIS)” so I said that sounds weirdly fun and pulled the trigger. First
      class of the semester was Prelude to Problem Solving with my teacher, Kirsten
      Markley. Mrs. Markley was a phenomenal programming teacher, and in all honesty
      I do not know if I would still be programming today if she had not taught that
      class, and began my love of software development. Since then I have been programming
      for roughly 5 years now and I have one more year of college left before I graduate
      with a Bachelors in Computer Science. </p>
      <p class="indent">I have quite a love for all programming and problem solving. From web development
      to desktop applications my programming skills have expanded drastically from
      those first days of writing “Hello World” to the console with python. I try
      to learn new things everyday, from just starting to learning javascript, to
      freshening up my html/css skills with this very website. Programming I just
      a fantastic way for me to sharpen my brain and keep my creative side satisfied.</p>
