    <h3>My Smart Home</h3>
    <h6>4.7.20</h6>
    <br>

    <img id="i0" src="../images/homeApp.jpg" alt="Home App Icon">
    <p class="indent">Whenever I have guest over, I am always excited to show off my smart home. My entire apartment is
      made up of HomeKit devices from the lights all the way down to my air purifier. I have been building out my smart
      home for a few years now and it still brings me joy to be able to shout out into the air to control nearly
      everything in my home. Where the real magic comes in is through automation. My home is on a schedule to wake me,
      get my morning going, lock up everything once I leave, and turn the lights on and unlock the door once I get home.
      Whenever I am thinking about new devices for my home, I try to think of how I can fit it into my automated life.
      As my life moves on and I eventually grow into a bigger house I will try to keep this blog updated as to some
      automations that seem to appreciably make my life easier.</p>

    <h3>Quarantine Thoughts</h3>
    <h6>4.4.20</h6>
    <br>
    <p class="indent">
      I know the circumstances are not the greatest, but given this free time is something that I really appreciate.
      There are projects that I have been excited to start for a while like this website and updating my GitHub with
      code from the past. I am happy to have been given this time during quarantine to catch up on doing said things. I
      have also been given the opportunity to spend some quality time with my family, time I thought I would never get
      again since moving out over a year ago. Either way I feel very fortunate to have been given this time to spend on
      myself and some quality time to spend with my family, and for that I am grateful.

    <h3>My First Post</h3>
    <h6>4.2.20</h6>
    <br>
    <p class="indent">With this being my first post, I wanted to share my ultimate goals for this blog. I really hope
      for this to be a great outlet for all the nerdy interests that I donâ€™t really feel like sharing on social media.
      This could entail things like my affection for HomeKit stuff or my love for Apple. I truly want this to be a place
      for me to get my opinions out there, even if nobody reads them. Also not having a safe place for my writings has
      not been great so having this will be a great opportunity for me.</p>
