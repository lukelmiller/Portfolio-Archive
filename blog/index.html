        As I am staying with my parents to save money and spend time with them during quarentine, there
        a few things I miss about my apartment, two of which being, the internet and my HomeKit setup.
        First off, the internet, it's so helpful. I don't know if you've ever used it but
        its like a place where you can do everything with the push of a button,
        truly amazing stuff. Then my smart home, even though it is controlled with a HomePod,
        and Siri is mostly garbage, being able to say something into the air and have
        things change in your home is next level stuff. I have smart-ified most of the
        things: the lights, the doorbell, the thermostat, locks, the vaccum, the humidifier,
        speakers, and the alarm system. When think of something new I want for my
        apartment, I first think of how it can make my life easier through automation.
        Not only because automated devices are cool, but also extremely convenient. Being away from
        all my cool tech has made me really miss tinkering and designing my spaces
        around it. One of the things I've been wanting to put in my space are the new Ikea
        smart blinds. I think it super futuristic to able to automate my natural lighting to wake me up with the sun,
        while having privacy while I sleep. These are just some of the really neat
        things I can do and wish to do with my smart spaces in the future.</p>
      <p class="indent">To get a bit meta, with
        this blog I really wanted to kinda get my feet wet talking about my smart home.
        This subject is one I that really doesn't overlap with any of my friends so
        this blog and reddit are my only ways I can talk about my it and so this
        avenue is something I have wanted to create for a while, without really knowing
        the best way of going about it. So thank you for reading and I hope you
        look forward to more writings about this to come.

      <h3>Quarantine Thoughts</h3>
      <h6>4.4.2020</h6>
      <br>
      <p class="indent">
        I do not know
        what kind of monkey's paw I used but right before all this quarantine stuff happened
        but I was so very burned out at work. Although I truly do miss my cowokers, I honestly
        think this time I have been given is the silverist of linings. Even though I got laid
        off, I have been given so much time with my parents that I did not ever think
        would happen again post moving away for school. I was thinking the other day
        about how people always say to enjoy the now, but I don't think many ever heed
        that warning. I am choosing to make it a conscious goal to really enjoy this time with my family
        because I think I will look back at this time with very sweet memories given
        awful circumstances. For this time I never knew I wished for, I am greatful and
        happy.

      <h3>My First Post</h3>
      <h6>4.2.2020</h6>
      <br>
      <p class="indent">With this being my first post I wanted to share my ultimate goals for this
         page of my site. I really hope for this to be a great outlet for all the nerdy
         stuff that I donâ€™t really feel like sharing with my non-nerdy social media
         friends. This could entail things like my affection for HomeKit Technologies
         or my love for politics. I truly want this to be a place for me to get my
         opinions out there, even if nobody reads them. Also not having a safe place
         for my writings has not been optimal so maybe one day someone will get a tiny
         bit of joy out of these that I want to put in. Anywho thank you for reading,
         and stay kind & stay safe (were in the 2020 quarentine at the moment for context).</p>
