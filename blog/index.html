      <h3>Quarantine Thoughts</h3>
      <h6>4.4.2020</h6>
      <br>
      <p class="indent">
        I do not think as humans we are ever satisfied. I do not know
        what kind of monkey's paw I used but right before all this quarantine stuff happened
        I was so very burned out at work. Although I truly do miss my cowokers, I honestly
        think this time I have been given is the silverist of linings. Even though I got laid
        off, I have been given so much time with my parents that I did not ever think
        would happen again post moving away for school. I was thinking the other day
        about how people always say to enjoy the now, but I don't think many ever heed
        that warning. I am choosing to make it a conscious goal to really enjoy this time with my family
        because I think I will look back at this time with very sweet memories given
        awful circumstances.

      <h3>My First Post</h3>
      <h6>2.4.2020</h6>
      <br>
      <p class="indent">With this being my first post I wanted to share my ultimate goals for this
         page of my site. I really hope for this to be a great outlet for all the nerdy
         stuff that I donâ€™t really feel like sharing with my non-nerdy social media
         friends. This could entail things like my affection for HomeKit Technologies
         or my love for politics. I truly want this to be a place for me to get my
         options out there, even if nobody reads them. Also not having a safe place
         for my writings has not been optimal so maybe one day someone will get a tiny
         bit of joy out of these that I want to put in. Anywho thank you for reading,
         and stay kind & stay safe (were in the 2020 quarentine at the moment for context).</p>
