      <h3>Academics</h3>
      <br>
      <p class="indent">Education has always been an important aspect of my life.
        Everyday I attempt, not always so gracefully, to learn
         something new. The thirst for knowledge was the greatest
         gift my parents ever passed down, and I strive everyday to gain
         knowledge, through any avenue possible, including my mistakes.
         Currently I am attending college at the
         University of Arkansas but I am proud be apart of many other
         communities for learning.</p>

      <h3>Color</h3>
      <br>
      <p class="indent">When I was in grade school I would always play slug-bug with my
        much older, much stronger brother. I would yell "RED", and hit him with all the
        force I could muster, which to him was like a moth flying into a giant.
        This was always followed by my parents chuckling. Well come to find out, they were NOT
        laughing at that sweet bloody piece of revenge I was enacting on my brother,
        but instead were laughing at me calling an orange VW Beatle red.
        My brother didn't seem to notice the difference either. Well come to find out,
        my brother and I are both color blind. Then on top of that, BAM, I find out I am also dyslexic, like my father.
        This made so much sense because my teachers always thought I was as dumb as a rock.
        So it was a relief to find that I wasn't completely dumb, I just couldn't read well or see color.</p>

      <p  class="indent">On a more serious note, these were things I never knew made me different, if
      anything they only slowed me down and caused me to have to explain to new
      people why my clothes never match. Disabilities
      are the things for which the world is not designed. So when I set out to
      create or build something new, I design it to
      be accommodating to everyone. Whether that be applications that take
      full advantage of accessibility features or designing my home so that
      everyone can feel safe knowing they will able to use almost everything in it without
      boundaries. Good design is built for a lot of people. Great design is built for everyone.
      I only wish to design things that are great.</p>

      <h3>Family</h3>
      <br>
      <p class="indent">Miriam Primrose Miller was my grandmother on my fathers side. She was
      a mother to 3 daughters and 5 sons, grandmother to 30+ grandkids, and
      great-grandmother to 40+ great-grandchildren. She was a complete and ethereal LEGEND.
      One of the sweetest women I have ever know. She was the one who taught
      me the importance of family and taking care of others. A women that would give
      her house to anyone who needed a roof for the night or feed
      you the little food she had in her fridge because she “didn’t need it”.
      She ended up living the last few years of her life in my parents home
      where we got to give back some of the love and care she gave so many
      throughout her 90 years. I carry these lessons of love in my heart
      everyday. Every moment, I try to treat the people around me like family,
      because if she can give so much with so little, then we all can.</p>

      <h3>Lost</h3>
      <br>
      <p class="indent">Growing up a chunky kid teaches you lots of lessons in
        character. I knew no matter how many times I was bullied for
        having bigger boobs then most of the girls in my grade,
         that one day I would lose the weight. It was a
         matter of time before I came to terms with myself. I knew I had it in me
         to overcome the weight. I also knew it would require an
         enormous change in my life and that was not an easy confrontation.
         Sophomore year of high school I decided to take that fat bull by the horns.</p>

     <p class="indent">I worked out an hour everyday and counted every single calorie
        till I retrained my mind to not eat like every day was a cheat day. After tons of hard work I lost
        about 2 pounds per week for an entire year. 100 pounds later, I went from 270 pounds
        all the way down to 168. This wasn’t the end of my journey though, in fact
        that was the easy part. Now I had to wrestle with the lot of self-esteem issues.
        When you go from being really big your whole life to suddenly looking like pre-serum Captain America,
        that is an image your brain is not familiar with, and you picture yourself with all the weight still on.
        I am proud to say today that I have finally fought for self confidence with myself
        and won. After years of people breaking me down, I have finally built myself
        up, and that struggle has only emboldened my heart. Those who put me down only
        made me stronger for it, and for that I am grateful.</p><a id="prideTarget"></a>

      <h3>Pride</h3>
      <br>
      <p class="indent"> Ok, this one was a big one for me so get ready for some serious stuff.
      September 16, 2017, after dealing with so much pain in my heart and soul,
      I had realize it was time to finally be myself. On this day I decided to finally
      tell my parents that I am gay, two weeks later I came out to my siblings,
      and now I live everyday proud of the man I am. I am privileged to live in a world where I
      do not have to hide what is underneath, and for that I am so greatful.
      I have so much support from my friends and family and I cannot explain
      to anyone how wonderful it is to have such amazing people in your life
      and to know they will support you no matter who you are.</p>
      <p class="indent">Through all this, I try to live every day putting in the work to support
      everyone around me, no matter what they look like or how they speak or any
      way their life might be different from mine.
      Justice and equality make up so much of my character, and I truly believe
      this world wasn’t meant for any one soul, but every soul. Being together
      as one humanity is what makes us strong, this earth is one we all walk
      on with no choice in how the world comes at us, but all the choice in
      how we treat the world.

      <h3>Programming</h3>
      <br>
      <p class="indent">Senior year of high school I got offered the opportunity to go to the local
      community college in the mornings and attend classes for free by means of my high
      school. I looked through the myriad of different programs they had, knowing that I wanted to do
      something toying with computers.
      When I came across their program called “Computer Information
      Science (CIS)” I thought that sounded weirdly fun and I pulled the trigger
      almost instantly.</p>

      <p class="indent">First class of the semester was 'Prelude to Problem Solving' with, my teacher, Kirsten
      Markley. Mrs. Markley was a phenomenal teacher, and in all honesty
      I do not know if I would still be programming today if it weren't for her
      class. I fully blame her for my love/hate relationship with software development.
      Many years later, and I am about to graduate
      with a Bachelors in Computer Science, I do not know where I'd be today if
      it weren't for programming (probably a mob boss or something, who
      knows). Programming has been my super power
      and I am so proud of path it has lead me down.</p>
