    <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>

    <h3>Academics</h3>
    <br>
    <p class="indent">Education has always been an important aspect of my life. The thirst for knowledge was the
      greatest gift my parents ever passed down, and I strive every day to gain new knowledge especially through my
      mistakes. I am a proud alumni of some great schools that have taught me numerous lessons not only about my studies
      but about life. I recently finished my academic career at the University of Arkansas studying Computer Science. I
      loved my studies there, and I am grateful to all the teachers who put in the effort and cared so deeply for us
      students.</p>

    <h3>Color</h3>
    <br>
    <p class="indent">In kindergarten art class my teacher would always be so curious as to why I would draw the sky
      purple or the grass brown. Well come to find out both my brother and I were diagnosed with color vision
      deficiency, or
      more communally referred to as - colorblindness. In all honesty it has not been huge hindrance on me, but it did
      open my eyes to how the world treats disabilities. The world is not built for people with vision or hearing
      impairments, or people with disabled mobility. When I decide I wish to build something, accessibility is always at
      the forefront. Great design can be used by everyone, and if I am creating something I want it to reach no
      short of greatness.</p>

    <h3>Family</h3>
    <br>
    <p class="indent">My grandmother, Miriam Primrose Miller, was a mother to eight children, a grandmother to more than
      30 grandchildren, and a great-grandmother to more than 40 great-grandchildren. After being diagnosed with
      dementia, she stayed the last few years of her life at my childhood home while I was growing up. She was one of
      the sweetest people I have ever met and the lessons she taught reside with me to this day. The final and
      greatest lesson she taught me is that family is your legacy. This not only applies to the family you are given,
      but the family that you make. I am proud to have made a great family of friends and loved ones and I am proud to
      have been her legacy, and proud of the legacy that I will one day leave behind.</p>

    <h3>Lost</h3>
    <br>
    <p class="indent">Growing up an overweight kid teaches you many lessons in character. I was bullied a lot in school
      about
      my size. I always knew one day my weight would not determine who I was. I knew I would persevere, and that’s
      exactly what I decided to do. Sophomore year I decide I was no longer going to be overweight. After my mind was
      made up it was all over from there. I dieted, exercised, danced, fought, and sweated my way to losing 100 pounds
      in a year. Well come to find out losing weight doesn’t change you. Yeah, you are typically healthier and might
      live longer but what really must change is your mindset. Your confidence, it comes from within and no amount of
      dieting or exercise can change that. The years that followed I kept the weight off but more importantly I decided
      who I was going to be. I no longer let the bullies make me feel lesser, I finally let the real me shine. In the end
      I am glad I lost the weight but what I am really proud of is that I discovered how great the real me actually is,
      without the voices of bullies getting in my way.</p><a id="prideTarget"></a>

    <h3>Pride</h3>
    <br>
    <p class="indent">September 16, 2017, after dealing with much pain in my heart and soul, I had realized it was
      finally time to be myself. I decided to finally tell the world that I was gay. I struggled with being gay for most
      of my teenage years knowing I was different, knowing what I was feeling was not of the typical teenage boy. Being
      from the south I knew being gay would not be the easiest thing to reveal to people, so I hid it away till I got
      out of high school. After getting out of that small town I grew up in and away from the homophobic people of my
      past I was finally able to be my true self. I will not say it has always been easy since coming out, I lost some
      of my closest loved ones and many cherished friends, but life would be way harder hiding from myself. I can say
      love
      is love without any second thoughts now and I am happier for that every day.</p>
    <p class="indent">
      [EDITORS NOTE] I contemplated long and hard, weighing various advice on whether I should exclude this section from
      my ‘about me’ page. The reason being that there is a high potential for employers to disqualify me from a
      position given that I am gay. I see this more as a feature rather than a bug; I don’t think I would ever fit into
      a place that would account for my sexuality when weighing whether I am fit for a job or not. People’s careers make
      up much of their happiness or their suffering, and for my own happiness I would rather work a place where I can
      truly be myself.

    <h3>Programming</h3>
    <br>
    <p class="indent">Senior year of high school I got offered the opportunity to go to the local community college and
      learn how to program. My programming teacher, Kirsten Markley, instilled upon me my love for programming. Her class
      taught me many great programming skills and new ways of thinking about problems. I would not be where I am
      today without her class, and five years later I graduated with distention from a major university with a
      bachelor’s degree in computer science. This is only the beginning though as I embark into the job market with my new
      skills ready for what is ahead. Programming is now a part of me, and I hope to be able to use my skills in
      building a better world for the future kids just looking for a fun class to take their senior year of high school.</p>
